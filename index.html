                    <p>Rinse the baingan (eggplant or aubergine) in water. Pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Apply some oil
                        all over and\r\nkeep it for roasting on an open flame. You can also grill the baingan or roast
                        in the oven. But then you won't get\r\nthe smoky flavor of the baingan. Keep the eggplant
                        turning after a 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that its evenly\r\ncooked. You could also embed
                        some garlic cloves in the baingan and then roast it.\r\n2. Roast the aubergine till its
                        completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid\r\neasily
                        in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it
                        cools\r\ndown.\r\n3. You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in
                        the baingan. This is an optional step.\r\nUse natural charcoal for this method. Heat a small
                        piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red.\r\n4. Make small cuts on the
                        baingan with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the
                        roasted\r\naubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin
                        to smoke.\r\n5. As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate
                        tightly with a large bowl. Allow the\r\ncharcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 2 minutes. The
                        more you do, the more smoky the baingan bharta will\r\nbecome. I just keep for a minute.
                        Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is\r\ncooked, just
                        like the way we do for Dal Tadka.\r\n6. Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked
                        eggplant.\r\n7. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it.\r\n8. In a kadai or
                        pan, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic.\r\n9. Saute the onions till
                        translucent. Don't brown them.\r\n10. Add chopped green chilies and saute for a minute.\r\n11.
                        Add the chopped tomatoes and mix it well.\r\n12. Bhuno (saute) the tomatoes till the oil starts
                        separating from the mixture.\r\n13. Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix well.\r\n14. Add
                        the chopped cooked baingan.\r\n15. Stir and mix the chopped baingan very well with the
                        onionÂ­tomato masala mixture.\r\n16. Season with salt. Stir and saute for some more 4 to 5
                        minutes more.\r\n17. Finally stir in the coriander leaves with the baingan bharta or garnish it
                        with them. Serve Baingan Bharta with\r\nphulkas, rotis or chapatis. It goes well even with
                        bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.</p>
